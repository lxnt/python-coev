Greenlet fork/split - the python bindings.

Split, rename, extensive modifications - Alexander Sabourenkov.

Original README text left over from the greenlet module:


This code is by Armin Rigo with the core pieces by Christian Tismer.
These pieces are:

- slp_platformselect.h
- switch_*.h, included from the previous one.

All additional credits for the general idea of stack switching also go to
Christian.  In other words, if it works it is thanks to Christian's work,
and if it crashes it is because of a bug of mine :-)
